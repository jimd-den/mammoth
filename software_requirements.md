1. Introduction
 * Purpose: This document outlines the software requirements for MAMMOTH, a versatile workflow management platform designed to empower users to digitize, standardize, and optimize their processes.
 * Scope: MAMMOTH will provide a user-friendly interface for creating and executing workflows, capturing data through forms, enforcing procedures with checklists, and logging data for analysis and reporting.
 * Target Audience: This document is intended for developers, designers, testers, and stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of MAMMOTH.
2. Overall Description
 * Product Perspective: MAMMOTH is a web-based application with a mobile-first design, accessible through a variety of devices. It will also offer a terminal-based interface for users who prefer command-line interaction and scripting.
 * Product Functions:
   * Workflow Creation:  Users can create workflows by defining a sequence of steps, including forms, checklists, conditional branches, and other actions.
   * Form Builder:  Users can create customized forms with various field types, validation rules, and conditional logic.
   * Checklist Builder:  Users can create checklists with customizable items, descriptions, and conditional visibility.
   * Workflow Execution:  Users can execute workflows, completing forms, checking off checklist items, and following the defined flow.
   * Data Logging:  MAMMOTH automatically logs data from forms and checklists, with options to store data in various locations (internal database, external databases, cloud storage, spreadsheets).
   * Reporting and Analysis:  Users can access and analyze log data to track progress, identify trends, and generate reports.
3. Specific Requirements
 * Functional Requirements:
   * Workflow Management:
     * Create, edit, and delete workflows.
     * Define workflow steps using a bullet-point or arrow-list interface.
     * Specify the sequence of forms, checklists, and other actions within a workflow.
     * Implement conditional logic to create dynamic workflows.
     * Designate specific forms as mandatory.
   * Form Management:
     * Create, edit, and delete forms.
     * Add, remove, and rearrange fields within a form.
     * Define various field types (text, number, date, dropdown, etc.).
     * Set validation rules for fields (required fields, data types, ranges).
     * Implement conditional rendering of fields based on user input.
     * Enable field-by-field rendering for improved focus.
   * Checklist Management:
     * Create, edit, and delete checklists.
     * Add, remove, and rearrange checklist items.
     * Add descriptions, images, or videos to checklist items.
     * Implement conditional visibility of checklist items.
   * Data Logging:
     * Automatically timestamp every log entry.
     * Provide options for storing log data in various locations (internal database, external databases, cloud storage, spreadsheets).
     * Allow users to map form and checklist fields to log destinations.
     * Implement data transformation options before logging.
   * User Interface:
     * Develop a responsive, mobile-first website for the MVP.
     * Ensure all elements are touch-optimized for mobile interaction.
     * Provide a clean and intuitive interface for workflow creation, form building, and checklist management.
     * Implement a terminal-based interface for command-line interaction and scripting.
 * Non-Functional Requirements:
   * Performance:  The application should be responsive and efficient, even with complex workflows and large datasets.
   * Security:  Protect user data and ensure secure access to the application and data stores.
   * Reliability:  The application should be stable and reliable, with minimal downtime.
   * Usability:  The interface should be intuitive and easy to use for users with varying technical skills.
   * Maintainability:  The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend.
   * Scalability:  The application should be able to handle increasing numbers of users and workflows.
4.  Constraints
 * Technology:  The application will be developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a suitable backend framework.
 * Time:  The MVP should be developed within a defined timeframe.
 * Budget:  The development should adhere to a defined budget.
5.  Assumptions and Dependencies
 * User Skills:  Users are assumed to have basic computer literacy and familiarity with web-based applications.
 * Third-Party Services:  The application may rely on third-party services for database hosting, cloud storage, or other functionalities.
6.  Future Enhancements
 * User Roles and Permissions:  Implement different user roles with varying levels of access and permissions.
 * Collaboration Features:  Allow users to share workflows and collaborate on process improvement.
 * Advanced Analytics:  Provide more sophisticated tools for data analysis and visualization.
 * Integration with Other Systems:  Enable seamless integration with other business applications (e.g., CRM, ERP).
 * Offline Functionality:  Allow users to access and execute workflows even without an internet connection.
